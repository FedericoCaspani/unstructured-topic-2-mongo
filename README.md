# MongoDB dataset

This is the student project done by Sergei Nabatov, Nikita Rozov, Matteo Citterio, Federico Caspani, Oleksandr Schukchlyi

The main purpose of this project is to provide an overview of what we have done for the second part of the project in the course "Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured data" in Politecnico di Milano.
The project required an implementation of a small document-oriented dataset based on MongoDB that could be queried for tracking the spread of a virus. Along that we have developed the code for a simple application for interacting with the dataset.
